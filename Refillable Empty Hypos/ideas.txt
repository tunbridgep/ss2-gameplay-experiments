Idea 1: "Secmod Style"

- Using a hypo adds an empty hypo, chance based on Cyb
- Refillable via annelid healing/psi glands
	- Glands are usable, but crappy by themselves

Idea 2: "Dark Souls Style"

- Most hypos in the game removed.
- Occasionally find "empty hypos"
- Using a hypo gives you an empty hypo
- Around the station there are various "Healing stations" which let you refill your hypos with either healing serum or mind serum.
	- Healing stations break after X uses, determined by Cyb
	- Hacking gives you an extra 2-3 uses.
- Psi Boosters are unaffected
